# Comparison-of-Different-Modems-and-Investigating-Their-Trade-Offs-Based-On-Applications-
the following report presents a 
comparative analysis of different 
modulation schemes for the selection of a 
modem (modulator-demodulator) based 
on key performance metrics such as 
spectral efficiency, bandwidth efficiency, 
transmit power, noise characteristics, and 
channel variations. The objective is to 
evaluate the trade-offs and identify the 
most suitable modem for a specific 
application. In this study, four individual 
voice messages were recorded, modulated 
using different modulation schemes, 
transmitted through a guided medium, 
and demodulated them at the receiver 
side. The performance of each modem 
was evaluated based on signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR), bandwidth, distance between 
transceivers, and distortions. The 
findings were analyzed and a generic 
recommendation for modem selection 
was provided.
